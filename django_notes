CHANING AN APP NAME
The app name corresponds to the directory name and there are a lot of references to this name throughout the project (like in urls, settings, views etc) but if you just go ahead and search-replace them you should be good

SCHEMA CHANGES (Not migrations :( )
Fairly painless approach to upgrading schema
1, delete all the relevant objects in the db :(

  In [7]: File.objects.all().delete()

2, drop the table, use python manage.py sqlclear for help

  $ python manage.py sqlclear filesync > sqlclear
  $ sqlite3 filesync.db
  SQLite version 3.5.9
  Enter ".help" for instructions
  sqlite> .read sqlclear

3, Update schema in models.py or whatever

3, Rebuild tables
  $ python manage.py syncdb
