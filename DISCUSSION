Django's built in webserver serves the same function as the restlets webserver but since Python is interpreted Django can simply re-load the source every time it detects an update to the source. This makes development much faster as it removes not only the compile cycle but the server restart step as well. In practice this means that the edit cycle, for many practical cases, is distilled down to a source edit followed by a browser refresh.
